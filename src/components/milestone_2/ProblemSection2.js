        <u>How we identified the problem:</u>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our team recognized a recurring issue in the travel space: travelers often face an
        <strong> overwhelming volume of information from various platforms.</strong> We’ve all experienced it ourselves—the constant switching between apps, endless tabs for travel guides, reviews, and maps, all in the pursuit of planning that perfect trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also noticed that <strong>most current platforms focus on promoting popular destinations</strong>, leaving lesser-known yet potentially amazing locations hidden. This bias toward well-known spots not only limits travelers' choices but also contributes to overcrowding. By highlighting these gaps, we felt confident that TravelGenius could provide a real, valuable solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team observed that another significant concern for travelers is <strong>safety</strong>, especially in unfamiliar destinations. An extensive analysis of travel forums, online reviews, and personal interactions revealed another issue: <strong>popular tourist attractions often become overcrowded</strong>, which not only diminishes the visitor experience but also raises safety and logistical concerns. For instance, if many travelers happen to receive the same recommendations for attractions at the same time, this can lead to congestion, safety hazards, and reduced enjoyment. Personal experiences and discussions with frequent travelers highlighted that an effective travel advisory system should take into account the distribution of tourists to ensure a smoother and safer experience.
