        To validate our assumptions, we designed a Customer Discovery plan centered on gathering real insights from potential users. Hereâ€™s what we set out to do:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Understand travelers' main challenges with current travel planning tools and validate if our idea of a personalized, discovery-focused travel assistant resonated.</li>
        <li><strong>Approach</strong>: We conducted both surveys and interviews to get a sense of what are the needs and problems regarding tourism.</li>
